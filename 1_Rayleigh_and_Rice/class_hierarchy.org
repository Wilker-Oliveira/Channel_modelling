   - generates the channel virtual implementation
   - PSD and autocorrelation(=Calculated by another class=)
   - Rice and Rayleigh probability density function
   - Rice and Rayleigh level-crossing rate(=Calculated by another class=)
   - The average duration of fades(=Calculated by another class=)
** Spectral properties 
   Responsabilities:
   - Jakes PSD
   - Jakes Autocorrelation
   - the "Beta" quantity for Jakes PSD
   - Gaussian PSD
   - Gaussian Autocorrelation
   - the "Beta" quantity for Gaussian PSD
