* 2nd topics
** SoS model class(virtual class)
   Responsabilities:
   (one channel "realization") 
   - Estimate the channel parameteres (estimate and set this in the class attributes)
   - keep the channel parameter (class attributes, should have a getter)
     + path gain
     + discrete dopples frequencies
     + phases
   - generate a time realization of the channel (only return not keep)
** Deterministic Properties
   Responsabilities:
