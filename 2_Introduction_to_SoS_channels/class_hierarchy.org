*Class hierarchy design for the channel modelling repository*

* 2nd topics
** SoS model class(virtual class)
   Responsabilities:
   (one channel "realization") 
   - (virtual function)Estimate the channel parameteres (estimate and set this in the class attributes)
   - keep the channel parameter (class attributes, should have a getter)
     + path gain
     + discrete doppler frequencies
     + phases
   - generate a time realization of the channel (only return not keep)
** Deterministic Properties
   Responsabilities:
   - +Mean value+
   - Mean power
   - Autocorrelation function
   - Cross-correlation function
   - /Autocorrelation function of the envelope/
   - /Autocorrelation function of the squared envelope/
   - Power Spectral Density(PSD)
   - Cross-power Special Density
   - /PSD of the envelope/
   - /PSD of the squared envelope/
   - Average doppler shift
   - Doppler spread
   - Periodicity
   - Level-Crossing Rate
   - Average duration of fades
