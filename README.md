# Channel_modelling
This repository contains the implementation of Channel models and tools for channel modelling and analysis,
the reference material for this implementations is some exercises from UFC teleinformatics department and also Mobile Fading Channels by Matthias Pätzold,
almost all the implementations and code examples were made in C++20 standard and with some scripts in python3
the software dependencies will be minimal and informed when needed it.

## Introduction
Through this discipline, it was performed the study of the principles of channel modelling, having as main reference the book "Mobile Radio Channels" by Matthias Pätzold. The first part (AICT I) consisted of the study and implementation of channel models using C++, in C++20 standard. The second part (AICT II) consisted of the development of a GUI for the execution and observation of the behaviour, the properties and the statistics of the channel models in a simple and intuitive manner.
