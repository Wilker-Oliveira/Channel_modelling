# Channel_modelling
This repository contains the implementation of Channel models and tools for channel modelling and analysis,
the reference material for this implementations is some exercises from UFC teleinformatics department and also Mobile Fading Channels by Matthias PÃ¤tzold,
almost all the implementations and code examples were made in C++20 standard and with some scripts in python3
the software dependencies will minimal and informed when needed it.
