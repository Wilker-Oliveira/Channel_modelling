### 1) Rayleigh and Rice processes as reference models

- Rayleigh and Rice process basic foundation (MFC 3.1 section)

- Rayleigh and Rice (Doppler) power spectral density (AKA Jakes power spectral density or Jakes PSD)
- Rayleigh and Rice Jakes autocorrelation function (3.9 and 3.10 MFC)
- Rayleigh and Rice Gaussian power spectral density (AKA Gaussian PSD)
- Rayleigh and Rice Gaussian autocorrelation function (3.11 MFC)

- Rice probability density function (highlight the rice factor in the formula)
- Rayleigh probability density function
- level-crossing rate for rice process
- level-crossing rate for rayleigh process
- Beta direct formula for Jakes PSD and Gaussian PSD (for faster level-crossing rate calculation)
- The average duration of Fades 

### 2) Introduction to the theory of deterministic processes

- Rice Method (superposition of an infinite number of weighted harmonic functions with equidistant frequencies and random phases.)

(Rice method based, Deterministic processes related)
- Mean value
- Mean power
- Autocorrelation function
- Crosscorrelation function
- Average doppler shift
- Doppler spread
- Periodicity

- Ergodicity test with respect to the mean value
- Ergodicity test with respect to the autocorrelation function

### 3) Methods for the computation of the model parameters of deterministic processes

- MED method (5.1.1 MFC)
- MSEM method (5.1.2 MFC)
- MEA method (5.1.3 MFC)
- MCM method (5.1.4 MFC)
- LPNM method (5.1.5 MFC)
- MEDS method (5.1.6 MFC)
- Jakes Method (5.1.7 MFC)
